In today's fast-paced digital landscape, the need for a website that is fast, secure, and easy to maintain is more important than ever. This is where static site generators come in.

A static site generator is a tool that takes content written in a markup language (such as Markdown or HTML) and generates a fully-fledged, static website. Unlike dynamic websites, which are built using a web application framework and rely on a server to generate and serve content, static sites are pre-built and can be served from a simple web server.

Here are some of the main benefits of using a static site generator in modern web development:

- Speed and performance: Static sites are fast, plain and simple. They don't rely on server-side logic, which means that the pages load quickly and don't put a strain on the server. This is especially important for mobile users who may be accessing your site on a slower connection.

- Security: Since static sites don't rely on server-side logic, they're less likely to be vulnerable to attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. This makes them a more secure option for sensitive information.

- Cost-effective: Because static sites don't require a backend, they are much cheaper to host and maintain. This makes them a great option for small businesses and personal projects.

- Flexibility: With a static site generator, you have full control over the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of your site. This allows for greater flexibility and customization compared to using a content management system (CMS) such as WordPress.

- Scalability: Static sites are easily scalable, as they can be served from a content delivery network (CDN) or a cloud storage service such as Amazon S3.

In conclusion, static site generators make sense in modern web development because they offer speed, security, cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and scalability. With the rise of Jamstack, which is a web development architecture that uses a static site generator as a frontend and various APIs and services as a backend, many companies are turning to static site generators as a suitable solution for their web development needs.
